    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am Zikar Nurizky, a third-semester Informatics student at Universitas Pembangunan Jaya and a lifelong learner.
    
    My insatiable thirst for knowledge has driven me to become a passionate learner with an unwavering commitment to
    personal and professional growth. Beyond my role as a student, I'm dedicated to empowering underprivileged students by
    teaching them the art of JAVA programming—a key that unlocks the digital world.
    
    I bring a unique blend of experiences to the table. My previous role as a customer service representative honed my
    problem-solving and communication skills. Additionally, I've had the privilege of promoting my campus to high school
    students across Jakarta, refining my public speaking abilities.
    
    This diverse background has equipped me with a wide range of valuable skills, including problem-solving, teamwork,
    proficiency in C and Java, and a solid understanding of statistics. I believe that the fusion of my passion for learning
    and my real-world experiences makes me a unique candidate for collaboration.
    
    Let's connect and explore opportunities to create positive change together!</p>
